# Android Concepts Practice Hub 🚀

Welcome to my Android Practice Repository! This repo is my personal playground where I’ve implemented various Android concepts using **Jetpack Compose**, **Kotlin**, **MVVM**, and other modern Android tech.

This space is constantly updated with mini-projects that help reinforce concepts like Location, Intents, AlarmManager, ExoPlayer, Paging, Sensors, Python integration in Android, and much more!

## 🧠 Developer Disclaimer

Hey fellow dev! 👋

Just a quick heads-up:  
This repository is a **practice zone** — a collection of small demos, concept tests, and code experiments. That means:

- 🧪 Some modules might not follow *perfect* best practices
- 🏗️ You may not see a full-blown architecture like MVVM in every folder
- 🚀 Focus is on **getting things working**, not on writing production-ready apps

Why?  
Because the goal here is **learning**, **exploring**, and **getting hands dirty** with code — fast and fun!

If you're looking for fully-architected projects, check out my other repos like [LHYTHM](https://github.com/Codexyze/Lhythm.git) or 
[Fashion Point](https://github.com/Codexyze/FashionPoint.git), where I’ve implemented proper MVVM,Clean ,Best Pratices, DI, Firebase, and more.
